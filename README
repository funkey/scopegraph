scopegraph
==========

scopegraph is a C++ library for scoped signalling. For that, scopes can be
defined in a directed acyclic graph that indicates subscope relations. Each
scope can be populated with agents who communicate by sending and receiving
signals. By default, agents send signals to all agents in their and lower
scopes and receive signals from all agents in their and higher scopes.
